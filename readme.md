### Run the project

In order to run the project locally, clone the repo, use the terminal to cd into its directory and make sure you install all of its dependencies by running `npm install`, then start the project by running the command `npm run dev`.

#### The idea

The idea behind this project is to bring a tool to my Warcraft friends where they'll be able to save as many talent builds as they want, since in-game they're only limited to 10 loadouts. After saving a set of however many talent builds you want, you can then generate a unique url that you'll link to that list of builds, enabling the user to keep track, share, and edit their sets of builds this way. In "edit mode" it'll just copy that set of builds and make a new set on top of that one, so that the old one isn't overwritten.

### The tools

Throughout this project I intend to learn and practice:
-Typescript --> everything points to TS being the future of any Javascript based tech, plus it's starting to feel really nice and convenient to use as I slowly get more and more into it

-TailwindCSS --> Earlier I've debated between Tailwind and styled-components for styling, and having already done two projects using styled-components, it is time for Tailwind! Since I'll be taking it slow while also incorporating TS, it seemed like a good opportunity to also begin my Tailwind journey.

-Vite: been trying to step away from create-react-app for a multitude of reasons, so this is the first project that I'll be starting with Vite! It seems super fast and covenient so far, and it's been an extremely easy install.

Feel free to drop suggestions or ideas to add to this project if you have some :)
